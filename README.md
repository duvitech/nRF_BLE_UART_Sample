 # nRF_BLE_UART_Sample
This is a newer version which defines how to pass controller between views, without the use of BLE Singletons and talk real time to the nRF BLE. 

Sample Bluetooth LE for UART application using iOS swift, this gives users an idea on how to pass the object to other view controller scenes. The code is referenced from Adafruit Basic Chat, nRF Toolbox, and several online forums. 

This is just an experimental app to communicate with Bluetooth LE using iOS, if I have missed to add any license please fell free to let me know so i can put that in.
The App is used to connect to a Nordic BLE, and send and receive byte array data and pass the connected peripheral to several view controller scenes and write/read data from those classes.
